All good thus far                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               So I'm back in [[L5097]], at the tail end of a one-way ticket.  Things are essentially going according to plan, with minor exceptions such as the part where EVA Airlines wouldn't let me on the plane until I shelled out $950 for a return ticket.  Tomorrow will be day two of the grand &quot;refund the expensive yet worthless return ticket&quot; adventure.

But hey, I got to watch the sun rising over Mt [[L2101]] this morning, and my favorite curry stall is still where I left it.  We'll call it good...
